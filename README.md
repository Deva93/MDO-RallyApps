MDO-RallyApps
=============

A sweet suite of apps.

## How to use these apps in your Workspace
All the apps are in the `dist/` folder.

__Before you install any app:__ You need to install the `dist/Workspace Configuration.html` custom app. This app configures the various things such as Trains, Horizontals, and locations of specific projects. 

After you install the `dist/Workspace Configuration.html` app, you can install any of the other apps in the `dist/` folder by copying the code into a custom app page in Rally.

__Many Apps have extra configuration__: Especially all the `SAFe` apps, like `dist/Team Report.html` and `dist/Risk Swimlanes.html`, etc... To look at these extra configuration options, __look at the Wiki__ page for that app.
