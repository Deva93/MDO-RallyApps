Program Board: 
1.  Change dependencies user story loading to only user stories in the release, or else one user story is going to be used for ALL the 
    unassigned dependencies. Figure out how to spread the randomness out, instead of picking the first from the random-list.
2.  Fix the Predecessor/Successor field clobbering issue
