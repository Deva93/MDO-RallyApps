Workspace Generic Apps
======================

To use these apps, you must first add the "Scrum Group Portfolio Config" app
and then set the Scrum Groups and Portfolio locations for your workspace. After 
that everything else should work (except the SAFe apps, read the README for them
for additional config instructions).

## Note on permissions
Many errors occur due to lack of proper permissions to edit projects. You need to be
a workspace admin to edit the workspace configuration app. You need to have editor
privileges to any project you want to add a dependency to. And you need editor access
to you portfolio projects (if they are different from your train project) if you want 
to edit risks and team-commits.
