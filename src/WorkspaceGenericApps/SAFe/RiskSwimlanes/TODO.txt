Allen's Decision: 
	- should Blocked/BlockedReason fields be added
	- should Archived field be added
	- should KanbanLastMovedDate field be added (this would affect Archived boolean field after certain date)
		> we would have to set a constant in RiskModel for 'DaysClosedUntilArchived' and look to archive risks when someone loads the page
