Allen's Decision: 
	- should contact field be added in addition to owner field?
	- are all fields mandatory? can we allow Description/Impact/MitigationPlan/ROAM to be undefined?
	- can a risk be blocked (do i have to add a blocked and a blockedReason field to risk)? 
	- should owner be editable ? or is the risk creator the owner?
	- should release be editable ? 
	
TODO:
	DONE - add colors to cards 
	DONE - add 'copy' card option
	DONE - create look and feel of cards in regular app
	DONE - create a universal modal for creating/editing/viewing risks
	DONE - implement drag and drop
	- Make sure KeyValueDb calls btoa(encodeURIComponent(<string>)) BEFORE checking the resulting length. 
		This will avoid rally stripping html tags
	- Remove ROAM field 
	- Validate Risks when we read them as well as write them, so deprecated Risk formats do not break current Risk apps assuming certain 
		fields exist or don't exist
	
	
	
MAYBE TODO:
	- create look and feel of modals/dialogs in regular app
	- inline editing of risk 'cards'
	- enable filtering by more than just owner like in the real kanban app
	- add a "which fields to show" button like in the real kanban app
